The county view wasn't to my taste (no icons for stats, holding view getting busy especially the modifiers grid) so I made my own version.

[H2]Features[/H2]
• Different look for the county view and building interface
• County and Holding stats shown with icons instead of text labels
• County Modifiers can be expanded
• Larger Barony tabs
• Holding information split in tabs
• Can display a lot more building slots
• Compact mode for the building construction UI
• Comparison Mode for the build/upgrade building UI
